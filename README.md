Model and UI for DraftKing's NBA Daily Lineup Challenge.

Problem Statement:
Our goal is to try and produce a modeling tool that outperforms an average DraftKings player in picking lineups for the Classic NBA daily Lineup Challenge. 

Plan:

1. Gather Data
  First we want to gather information that will help us set goals and benchmark our model's performance. Namely we want to learn:
    a. The average drafter's performance in an a contest
    b. What score a lineup must attain to recieve a payout
